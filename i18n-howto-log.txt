- Mark text in views for ugetext
- include 'load i18n' in template
- mark text in templatex for trans
- create locale dir in project root
- run ./manage.py makemessages -l <pt>
- run ./manage.py compilemessages

- In settings.py, you may now set availables languages:

LANGUAGES = (
        ('en','English'),
        ('pt','PortuguÃªs'),
)

and current language:

LANGUAGE_CODE = 'pt'

If you now change the LANGUAGE_CODE from 'en' to 'pt', you'll see diferente
translations in your application


==Now we have to let user change the language==

- Enable LocaleMiddleware in settings.py, adding LocaleMiddleware in
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
)

1- lokks for django_data in session;
2- looks for django_language cookie;
3- looks for Accept-language in HTTP header;
4- looks for LANGUAGE_CODE in settings.py
